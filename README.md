# Bosch D7412GV4 Fire/Security System, ported to Roblox
This system will be easy to use - D1255, D720 and other keypads with VFD will go into the SDI folder. Newer B series keypads (e.g. B925) will go into the SDI2 folder.

Thanks to the KCA security system for making this possible - this system plans to be as modular if not similar to theirs (No I do not want to copy) - support them @ https://git.chrischro.me/KCA/alarm-system
